# DeepLearning.AI-TensorFlow-Developer
## About this repository
> This is a repository to archive **the programming exercises and lecture notes** of DeepLeaning.AI-TensorFlow-Developer courses in Coursera.
You can go ['Wiki'](https://github.com/nkim505/DeepLearning.AI-TensorFlow-Developer/wiki) page and see the lecture notes I took. I started to save them just for myself. Please be aware that codes and notes could be seen messy to you. Sometimes it is written in Korean. :neckbeard:
