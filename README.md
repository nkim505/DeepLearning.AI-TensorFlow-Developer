# DeepLearning.AI-TensorFlow-Developer

### This is a repository to archive the programming exercises of DeepLeaning.AI-TensorFlow-Developer courses on Coursera. just for myself.
### So they could look organized in messy way for others.
### You can go ['Wiki'](https://github.com/nkim505/DeepLearning.AI-TensorFlow-Developer/wiki) page and see the lecture notes I took.
