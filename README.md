# DeepLearning.AI-TensorFlow-Developer
<br>
This is a repository to archive the programming exercises and lecture notes of DeepLeaning.AI-TensorFlow-Developer courses in Coursera.<br>
You can go ['Wiki'](https://github.com/nkim505/DeepLearning.AI-TensorFlow-Developer/wiki) page and see the lecture notes I took. 
I started to save them just for myself. Please be aware that codes and explanations could be seen in messy way to others.<br>
Thanks
